# A utility to automate Python project setup.
To use the setup wizard directly run the respective file.

## main_wizard

- set directory
- set name
- create venv
- install libraries
- init git repo

## venv_wizard

- create venv
- install libraries

## Future

Might add seperate "git_wizard" similar to the "venv_wizard" for faster setup.
Might seperate venv_wizard dependencies from main_wizard so it can work independently.
